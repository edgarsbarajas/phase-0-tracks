1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
  SELECT * FROM models;

  1|Mustang|160|false|1
  2|Challenger|165|false|3
  3|Charger|140|true|3
  4|Corvette|200|false|2
  5|Focus RS|140|true|1

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

  UPDATE models SET top_speed=180 WHERE name="Challenger";

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

  SELECT * FROM models JOIN makes ON models.make_id = makes.id;

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

  SELECT makes.name, models.name, models.top_speed FROM models JOIN makes ON models.make_id = makes.id;

  Ford|Mustang|160
  Dodge|Challenger|180
  Dodge|Charger|140
  Chevrolet|Corvette|200
  Ford|Focus RS|140

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

  DELETE FROM models WHERE name="Charger";

Try a few different joins in your database, and record the commands and the output in queries.txt

  SELECT * FROM models INNER JOIN makes ON makes.id = models.make_id;

  1|Mustang|160|false|1|1|Ford
  2|Challenger|180|false|3|3|Dodge
  4|Corvette|200|false|2|2|Chevrolet
  5|Focus RS|140|true|1|1|Ford

  -------------------

  SELECT * FROM models FULL OUTER JOIN makes ON makes.id = models.make_id;

  RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOINs are not currently supported
