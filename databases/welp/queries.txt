You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
  Add another JOIN/ON

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

  SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews
  JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id
  JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id;

  Mandy|Kaling|The Beagle Nightclub|5|Best nightclub in town!
  Amgela|Jolie|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|Cheap prices, the preist smelled funny
  Bradford|Pitt|Amir's Towing|1|Amir crashed my car

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

  SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews
  JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id
  JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id
  WHERE businesses.name = "Amir's Towing";
