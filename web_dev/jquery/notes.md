#MyPlan
# Google jquery "x" x = for beginners, intro, etc.
# Find the most reputable to begin
# Find Jquery docs and bookmark
# Rest when you feel overwhelmed
# Test what you learn as you go. For example, write out code when they do.

#WhatIActuallyDid
# I googled jquery to get a better sense of how it was used
# I stumbled upon a w3 course that explained everything pretty well
# Went through each page for about 2 hours, trying the examples they provided on my own
